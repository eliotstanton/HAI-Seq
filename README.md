## verify_download.pl
This program downloads FASTQ files from the SRA database using a list of SRR 
accessions and subsamples those files. Files downloaded from SRA are stored 
in directory $dir_downloads. Subsampled files are stored in directory $dir_down
sampled.

verify_download.pl -p [SUBSAMPLE PROPORTION] -l [SRR LIST]  
-p subsample proportion expressed as percentage (optional default: 30)  
-l text file containing list of SRA accessions to be downloaded (optional)  
    * If no text file is specified the default list will be used.
